  /// failing render (1170×2532): exactly **1,682 pixels differ at all (0.06%)**, every one of
  /// them inside a 93×93px box around the spinner glyph — a hard ceiling of 0.29% whatever
  /// phase it is caught in. But `precision` is evaluated by SnapshotTesting's Metal fast path
  /// as `1 - areaAverage(threshold(deltaE))`, and that float average over ~3M pixels has a
  /// noise floor far above a 0.06% signal: **0.995 fails, 0.993 passes**. The budget is
  /// therefore set by the estimator, not by the drift, and tightening it further buys nothing
  /// but a flaky test.

  /// What a fungible budget genuinely cannot rule out is a *small* regression elsewhere
  /// (a vanished control) passing inside it. That hole is closed structurally, not by pixels:
